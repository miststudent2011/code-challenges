# [SUM OF INTEGERS]

## CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION:

Write a program to determine the largest sum of contiguous integers in a list.

## INPUT SAMPLE:

The first argument is a path to a filename containing a comma-separated list of integers, one per line.

For example:

```
-10,2,3,-2,0,5,-15
2,3,-2,-1,10
```

## OUTPUT SAMPLE:

Print to stdout the largest sum. In other words, of all the possible contiguous subarrays for a given array, find the one with the largest sum, and print that sum.

For example:

```
8
12
```
